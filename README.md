"Jammming" project's main task is to help users in creating and saving new playlist of songs on one's Spotify profile. Mostly I use React framework and  Java Script, HTML, CSS cods. To start to use this program you need to login on Spotify profile in order to provide connection between sites using API REST.  The function of searching, adding and subtracking songs, albums and singers is avalible. The name of new playlist can also be changed.
